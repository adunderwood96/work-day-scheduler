# work-day-scheduler
## Challenge:
- This week's challenge focused on using web-API's such as Bootstap, JQurey, moment, etc. in order to build a work day scheduler. Having a platform where you can use it for CSS styles and JS functions was really interesting and made it easier to make a webpage look how you wish. For me, the hardest part was getting the color coordinating times with the current time to show what was past and future. Mostly due to the fact I was trying to use the time as 1,2,3 at first instead of starting off with my start time and going forward as I would with a 24hr clock. I added a clear btn to make it easier for the user to reset their day as well as alerts.
